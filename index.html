    <p class="f4 intro">
      You already write great code, and can figure out the latest frameworks. This 
      book isn't about that - it's about everything else. As such, there's very little 
      code inside, meaning everyone from PHP hackers to hardcore embedded C programmers
      will get a lot out of it.
