    <h2 class="f3 caps ss">Who is this book for?</h2>
    <p class="f4 intro mb4">
      You already write great code, and can figure out the latest frameworks. This
      book isn't about that - it's about everything else. As such, there's very little
      code inside, meaning everyone from PHP hackers to hardcore embedded C programmers
      will get a lot out of it.

    <p class="mb2">
      The Senior Software Engineer shows you simple techniques for fixing bugs,
      implementing features, and getting things done quickly. You'll be the most
      valuable engineer on your team in no time.
    </p>
    <h1 class="ss caps f4">Not interested in management?</h1>
    <p class="mb2">
      The Senior Software Engineer outlines what it means to be a technical leader.
      You'll learn to be a reliable decision maker without leaving what you love –
      programming – behind.

    <h1 class="ss caps f4">Want to do it your way?</h1>
    <p class="mb2">
      The Senior Software Engineer will teach you to lead by example. You'll become
      more than “just a programmer” — you'll be someone who consistently delivers
      results with software. Then you'll be in charge of how things get done.

          Speak directly to your system. With its simple commands, flags, and parameters,
          a well-formed command-line application is the quickest way to automate a backup,
          a build, or a deployment and simplify your life.
