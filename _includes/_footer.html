        I wrote “Build Awesome Command-Line
        Applications in Ruby”, and have over 16 years of professional development
        experience. I've managed high-performance, high-traffic systems at LivingSocial
        and helped build the engineering team at Opower. I've worked consulting gigs
        both large and small, commercial and government. I'm currently a lead engineer
        at fashion start-up Stitch Fix, building a platform that will change the retail
        shopping experience.
