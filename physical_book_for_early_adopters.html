    <h2 class="f3 caps ss">Thanks for Buying The Book!</h2>
    <p class="f4 intro mb4">
    As you may have heard, I've been working to get a physical copy of the book available to readers and potential buyers.  I've decided to go with
    <a href="lulu.com">LuLu</a>, the popular print-on-demand service.  The test copies I've gotten look and feel great—LuLu's product feels like a professionally-printed book.  You can see some photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davetron5000/sets/72157635266573533/">here</a> of what it looks like.
    </p>
    <p class="f4">
    I'm still working out pricing for new buyers but for you, the early-adopters that took a chance on me and this book, I wanted you to be able to get one as cheaply as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="f4">
    The cost for printing each book is $7.98, and I'm not looking to make additional money from you, so you can buy it at cost for a limited time, direct from LuLu using <a href="{{ site.secret_cheap_physical_book_link }}">this super-secret link</a>.
    <ul class="list f5">
      <li class="list-item">The book will cost $8 plus shipping and tax.  I'll be making a whopping 2 cents on each purchase.</li>
      <li class="list-item">Shipping, unfortunately, varies from a few bucks for US Media Mail (slow and cheap), to around $8 for the next fastest method.  I don't have control over this and don't make any money on shipping.  I <strong>can</strong> confirm that their shipping prices are reasonable.  LuLu also has no concept of promo or coupon codes, so there's not much I can do but sympathize.</li>
      <li class="list-item">Tax depends on where you live.</li>
      <li class="list-item">I'll retire this link by end of September (or if gets a lot of traffic from non-early-adopters buying it at cost), so use it soon.</li>
      <li class="list-item">If you live in DC or San Francisco, I might be able to hand-deliver it.  I'll also be in Sydney, Australia in October, so if you happen to be located there, there's a small chance.  In any case, <a href="#">Email me</a> and I'll see if we can work something out…no promises.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="f4">
    Thanks for reading, and <a href="{{ site.secret_cheap_physical_book_link }}">buy the physical copy here</a> if you're interested.
