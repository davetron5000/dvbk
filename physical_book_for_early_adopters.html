    <h2 class="f3 caps ss">Thanks for Buying The Book!</h2>
    <p class="f4 intro mb4">
    As mentioned, I've been working to get a physical copy of the book.  I've decided to go with
    <a href="lulu.com">LuLu</a>, who do print-on-demand.  The test copies I've gotten look and feel great—they do a great job printing what appears to be a professionally-printed book.  You can see some photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davetron5000/sets/72157635266573533/">here</a> of what it looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm still working out pricing for new buyers but for you, the early-adopters that took a chance, I wanted you to be able to get one as cheaply as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    The cost for printing each book is $7.98, and I'm not looking to make additional money from you, so I'm selling it at cost for a limited time, direct from LuLu using <a href="#">this super-secret link</a>.
    <ul class="list f5">
      <li class="list-item">The book will cost $8 plus shipping and tax.  I'll be making a whopping 2 cents on each purchase.</li>
      <li class="list-item">Shipping, unfortunately, varies from a few bucks for US Media Mail (slow and cheap), to around $8 for the next fastest method.  I don't have control over this and don't make any money on shipping.</li>
      <li class="list-item">Tax depends on where you live.</li>
      <li class="list-item">I'll retire this link by end of September (or if gets a lot of traffic from non-early-adopters buying it at cost), so use it soon</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you live in DC or San Francisco, I might be able to hand-deliver it.  <a href="#">Email me</a> and I'll see if we can work something out…no promises.
